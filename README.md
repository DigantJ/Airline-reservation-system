Developing an airline reservation system involved an integrated approach using Java, HTML, SQL, and JavaScript. Java served as the backbone, managing the backend logic and functionalities. Object-oriented programming in Java facilitated the creation of classes representing flights, passengers, bookings, and the overall system architecture. HTML and JavaScript were instrumental in building the frontend interface, allowing users to interact with the system through a web browser. HTML crafted the structure of web pages, while JavaScript added interactivity, such as form validation or dynamic content updates. SQL played a crucial role in managing the database, handling flight schedules, passenger details, and reservations. JDBC, the Java Database Connectivity, acted as a bridge between Java and the SQL database, ensuring seamless data exchange. This collaborative use of technologies resulted in a robust airline reservation system that provided users with a user-friendly interface for flight selection, booking, and management while ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
